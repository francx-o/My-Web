        <h3>
            Introduction
        </h3>
        <p>
            In this document, our goal is to disprove the claim that, God is the only eternal 
            entity that can exist. Our proof is made possible with an interesting concept, 
            space. However I personally believe that, n-eternal entities can exist but we 
            need only one example to disprove the earlier claim that, God is the only eternal 
            entity that exists. We will not go into n more than 2 entities infact we may never visit it as 
            my goal has been achieved. But it will be interesting to explore.
        </p>
        <p>
            This disproof is highly philosophical as I believe science alone cannot explain 
            all things. 
            It is difficult to explain the exact way the world beyond the physical is with 
            words so for some words we will use to ascribe to those entities beyond the 
            physical are highly symbolic - I'm just explaining something not showing the 
            exact thing. I know majority of you will have a problem with this but... 
        </p>
        <p>
            We are all familiar with God (A supernatural being that is believed to be 
            responsible for the creation of every single entity in the universe physical and 
            beyond even time and space) so we begin by explaining space but we ignore 
            time. I believe though space and time are deeply related and intertwine but they 
            are two different entities. I can explain space independent of time and time 
            independent of space...sorry Minkowski and Einstein. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that, the use if the word "physical" ascribes to physics, similar to 
            Biological, Chemical and Mathematical. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Notion Of Space
        </h3>
        <p>
            The term space is used colloquially to connote our 3-dimensional world which 
            contains physical objects but it goes beyond the 3-dimensional world we have 
            in mind especially with respect to physical objects. These are just  claims that show that only physical objects 
            and more specifically, tangible objects can exist in space but it goes beyond 
            that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Light do not occupy space they say but which space are they referring to? The 
            phsyical of course because it lacks some properties like mass, mainly. It is true 
            to some extent because of the way physics defines space and the nature of our 
            physical space.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Nature of space
        </h3>
        <p>
            Our physical space is not an empty space. It has energy - the vacumm energy. 
            Even if you manage to remove this energy, I believe space is not empty 
            because it has properties like curvature. How can emptiness curve? Think 
            about it. Space has an underlying structure. Some theories like loop quantum 
            gravity propose a structure such as quantum foam and so on.
        </p>
        <p>
             In all space has energy. There is an experimental confirmation that, light does 
            not require a medium to travel - the Michelson- Morley experiment. So you can 
            argue that, light does not occupy space. But this space is talking about the 
            physical space.
        </p>
        <p>
            We cannot disprove that light cannot occupy a physical space but we can claim 
            light occupies space if we take an abstraction on the nature of space. The 
            nature of space in mind is that; space can be explained as any region where 
            entities exist. Once an entity exist, it exist in space and there are different types 
            of spaces you can think of. This abstraction implies that, our 3-dimensional 
            space is just a subset of this abstraction. 
            You cannot exist independent of space similarly time but we focus on space for 
            now.
        </p>
        <p>
            Mathematics deals with a lot of abstraction. So we switch to the mathematical 
            notions of space and extend it to the physical world. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Mathematical Notion of a Space
        </h3>
        <p>
            Mathematics deals mostly with sets which has elements pionts. If we have 
            these points and some relation between them, we can call it a space. The only 
            thing mathematics may have added to my idea is the existence of a relation but 
            not just a mere existence. But still an entity  requires existence for a rule to 
            govern it. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Some types of mathematical spaces you can read about are Vector spaces, 
            Euclidean space, Hilbert space, Metric space and Calabi Yau space. These 
            spaces differ because of the relation between its elements. One space can 
            differ from the other at the same time one space can emerge from another 
            pointing to the fact that, a different spaces can be a subset of another space. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Applications of a Mathematical Space
        </h3>
        <p>
            Translating this knowledge to the physical, with the help of the concept of 
            symmetries, we can argue that one object in the physical space can also exist 
            in two or more spaces at the same time. Even our 3-dimensional space can 
            exist in another space since its not empty (imagine the vacuum energy is 0).
        </p>
        <p>
            This is where I can say confidently that, since light exist, it cannot exist 
            independent of a space. It cannot exist in the physical space, but exist in some 
            other space but can permeate our physical space due to some properties it 
            has
        </p>
        <p>
            We have been able to show that light occupies space so we can extend it to God.
        </p>
        <h3>
            Application to the Metaphysical
        </h3>
        <p>
            The same way light occupies space, God also occupies space. Since He exists 
            and He's not an idea. Even ideas should exist in a space of some kind. But 
            because its related to the problem of consciousness and I've not read much on 
            it I do not want to touch on it. Maybe if I become a professional philosopher, I 
            will touch on it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Anyways He exist in a space. Whether this space can be created is a problem 
            but i have an interesting answer.
        </p>
        <p>
            If space is a region where entities reside, then if a space is a physical object as 
            in our 3-dimensional space because of curvature and all that as discribed 
            earlier, then it can exist in another space. Also, a space can exist in a space ad 
            infinitum. Infinities and infinite regresses exist just that we don't have 
            explanations for them, we run away from it by bringing in first causes and 
            circular causality and other methods. Yeah infinities may not exist or make 
            sense in the physical world but in the metaphysical world it does exist. Note we 
            can have finite numbers of spaces.
        </p>
        <h3> 
            Creation of Space
        </h3>
        <p>
            Lastly, an object cannot create the space it finds its self in unless it is in another 
            space undertaking that activity. Let's assume an object in a finite system of 
            space. It cannot create the last space it finds itself in. Unless its created  by a 
            different being. But that being will also be in a space to create that space. So 
            another being should create its space. If we imagine only one being in 
            existence, then that being will also occupy space. Hence, space any can be 
            create but in a unit of finite spaces, there should be one space that wasn't 
            created for all the others to exist. I guess you know where this is going now?
        </p>
        <p>
            A corollary follows that, if God is eternal which means he wasn't created, my 
            favorite Thommy Aquinas puts it; Ipsum esse subsistent, then the space 
            accompanying him or that accommodates him wasn't created and is just 
            eternal as he is. Therefore space can be eternal.
        </p>
        <p>
            This competes the proof. Yes in Christianity we have omnipotence but if God is 
            omnipotent, think about this; God cannot create a stone so heavy that he 
            cannot lift it. If the statement is true then he is not omnipotent if he can he is 
            equally not omnipotent. 
        </p>
        <h3>
            Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p>
            We've discussed the nature of space. We found out that, space means more 
            than what physics presents us and that there can be other spaces that even our 
            3 - dimensional universe can reside. The notion of space has been 
            influenced by how physics communicates space to the public this has resulted 
            in a limited knowledge on this part of the universe. Hence, the use of space is 
            limited to only the 3-dimensional space. Space was created if the creator was in another space we 
            showed. Existence requires that you occupy space, so you cannot create the 
            space you find yourself in. We acknowledged the fact that, an infinite system of 
            space can exist and also a finite system of space can equally exist but our 
            focus was to prove the existence of any other eternal entity aside God so we 
            focused on the finite space since that will be of help. So if an entity is eternal 
            then, the space it occupies is also eternal. Hence, we proved the existence of 
            2-eternal entities. I am going for n-eternal entities so I'll be glad if you raise the 
            number to n more than 2. This has also made me understand how possible it is for God 
            to lives live and not be affected by our space.
